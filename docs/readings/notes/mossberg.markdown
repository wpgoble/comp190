# Mossberg: The false debate between open and closed in tech

* "Open is usually considered good, and closed is bad. But it 
turns out these words, which once really meant something, now 
have very loose definitions and surprising contradictions."

* "The Mac's OS X operating system and the iPhone's iOS operating 
system are proprietary, but both are built upon an open-source 
offshoot of Unix called BSD. Apple's proprietary Safari web browser 
uses an open-source engine called WebKit, which, until 2013, served 
as the basis for Google's competing Chrome browser."

* Open and Closed are more often mixed rather than separate.
