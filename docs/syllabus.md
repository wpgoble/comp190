### Learning Goals

Students will:
- gain proficiency with command line interaction with a Unix operating system including installation and configuration of software, shell scripting and basic system administration tasks.
- gain proficiency with modern software development tools and their common uses including a debugger and a version control system.
- deepen their understanding of social and ethical issues in computing and their appreciation of computing for the greater good.
- [WiD goal] develop their ability to produce clear, concise, technical writing for developers.



### Course Components

#### Readings & Discussions

A short reading on contemporary social/legal/ethical issues in computing will be assigned prior to most class meetings.  The class meeting will begin with a class discussion of that reading. You are expected to do the readings in advance and come to class prepared to contribute to the discussion. Note that while everyone is expected to prepare for every discussion, it is not required that everyone contribute to every discussion. However, you are expected to contribute regularly enough to demonstrate you are preparing and engaging with the materials.  Students who are failing to demonstrate sufficient engagement or participation will be given updates and suggestions for improvement.

To prepare for these discussions you might:
- Identify the main points made by the reading.
- Think about your position on any controversial or unsettled issues raised.
- Note things that you found interesting that you would like to hear your classmates opinions on.
- Prepare questions on things that were unclear to you.

#### Introductory Presentations

Each class will include a short introductory presentation to the day's topic by the instructor.  This introduction is intended to provide a big picture view of the topic and how it fits into the larger context of the course, software development and open source.  They are not intended to provide all of the information that you need to complete the activities.  

#### Activities

Following each introduction, you will complete a collection of activities that guide you through the development of the main ideas, techniques for solving problems and provide practice with the material.  These activities will start from the introductory material but will also contain additional videos/readings and guide you through the learning of additional new material that builds on the introductory material.  Typically there will be time at the end of each meeting to begin the activities.  You should expect that the Activities will require up to 3-4 hours total (Note: This is consistent with Dickinson’s standard that every hour in class is accompanied by 3 hours of work outside of class).

#### Command Cheat-Sheet

This class will be introducing a lot of new technologies, techniques and commands. The goal is not to memorize them all, but rather to learn what they do, how they work and when to use them.  Then in future situations you will have them in your toolbox when you need them. A "cheat-sheet" can be a useful technique for organizing this type of information so that you can quickly look it up or refresh your memory when you need it.  As you go through the activities you will be asked to create and keep up to date a cheat-sheet for the new things you are learning. You will turn this cheat-sheet in at the end of the semester to demonstrate a comprehensive awareness of what you have learned and that you have it as a valuable resource for future classes.

### Assignment Grading

Course assignments will be reviewed for completeness and individual questions will be marked with feedback to facilitate self-assessment of your understanding.  Overall, each assignment will be marked as “Competent” or “Not Yet Competent.”  **Any assignment marked “Not Yet Competent” must be revised and resubmitted.**  It is highly recommended that you complete this revision prior to the subsequent activity as it will often be dependent on the prior one.

### Course Grading

The COMP 190 course is graded as a Credit/No Credit course (see [Dickinson's Academic Policies and Procedures](https://www.dickinson.edu/download/downloads/id/10480/academic_policy_and_procedures.pdf)).

To receive credit for the course you must:
- Demonstrate engagement with the assigned readings through a track record of participating class discussions.
- Receive a "Competent" score on every Activity.
- Submit a "Competent" Command Cheat-Sheet at the end of the semester.

Recall that if any Activity or the Command Cheat-Sheet is marked "Not Yet Competent" it can be revised and resubmitted, multiple times if necessary to receive a "Competent" score.

### Academic Integrity

Please take the time to read the Academic Misconduct section of [Dickinson's Community Standards](https://www.dickinson.edu/download/downloads/id/11821/community_standards.pdf). Violations of this policy are considered serious transgressions, so you should be especially certain that you understand your rights and responsibilities under it. Students suspected of academic dishonesty will be subject to the process outlined in the [Student Conduct](http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/69/student_conduct) pages.

The specific policies for COMP190 are detailed below. If you are unsure about whether or not certain kinds of collaboration or sources are permissible on an assignment or in this course, ask your instructor.

##### Collaboration

Assignments in COMP 190 are individual assignments. Sharing or receiving of answers to assignments is not permitted. All work submitted must be your own work.

However, you are encouraged to interact and to help each other learn.  For example:
- You may ask and answer clarifying questions about assignments.
- You can ask for suggestions of other resources to use or how to proceed with an assignment.  
- You can ask questions about any of the course content.
- Etc.

All of these types of questions can be asked of the instructor or of your classmates, either in person or on the course Teams channel. You are encouraged to ask and respond on the Teams channel. If you ask in person, please also try to post what you learn to the channel. This will ensure that others with the same questions will have access to the same helpful information that you receive.

#####  Outside Sources

There are sites where answers can be looked up or where others can be asked for solutions. There are undoubtedly assignments from last year available to some of you. There are calculators and tools that will generate answers to some problems. Regardless of the availability of these materials, **the bottom line is that you are responsible** for ensuring your own mastery of the material. Failure to do so will limit your success in this class, future classes, internships and jobs that rely on this material.

That said, for some problems you will be expected to use web searches and outside sources. In those cases this will be explicitly indicated.  Otherwise, the expectation is that you should be able to answer the question based on what you already know combined with careful and creative thought and diligent effort. If you struggle with such a question, ask for suggestions (see Collaboration above).

### Intellectual Property Rights

Audio or video recording of class meetings, lectures or discussions is prohibited without explicit permission of the instructor. Photographic records of whiteboards, projected slides or other visual media is also prohibited without explicit permission of the instructor. In any case where permission is given for audio/video/photographic records to be made they are for personal use only. They may not be shared or redistributed and must be destroyed at the end of their usefulness or within one week following the termination of this course, whichever comes first. Similarly, any redistribution of sample code, homework solution sets or provided lab code is prohibited. Please note that all outside materials used in the course (readings/tutorials/assignments/projects/etc) are also be governed by their own licensing agreements.

### Accommodations for Disabilities

Dickinson values diverse types of learners and is committed to ensuring that each student is afforded equitable access to participate in all learning experiences. If you have (or think you may have) a learning difference or a disability – including a mental health, medical, or physical impairment – that would hinder your access to learning or demonstrating knowledge in this class, please contact Access and Disability Services (ADS). They will confidentially explain the accommodation request process and the type of documentation that Dean and Director Marni Jones will need to determine your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. To learn more about available supports, go to www.dickinson.edu/ADS, email access@dickinson.edu, call (717) 245-1734, or go to the ADS office in Room 005 of Old West, Lower Level (aka "the OWLL").

If you’ve already been granted accommodations at Dickinson, please follow the guidance at www.dickinson.edu/AccessPlan for disclosing the accommodations for which you are eligible and scheduling a meeting with me as soon as possible so that we can discuss your accommodations and finalize your Access Plan. If test proctoring will be needed from ADS, remember that we will need to complete your Access Plan in time to give them at least one week’s advance notice.

### Life Happens:

Sometimes stuff just happens, even more so in the challenging situations in we currently find ourselves. Sometimes it is an unexpected sudden event such as an illness or family emergency. Other times it may be an ongoing issue or concern or an accumulation of smaller issues. Any of these things may affect your (or my) ability to focus or perform up to your (or my) potential through no shortcoming or fault of your (my) own. Dickinson is a kind and caring community and we want to see you achieve at your full potential. So, if you are experiencing life events that are affecting your performance please don’t hesitate to talk to your instructor, your advisor or your class Dean. They will all be willing to talk with you, help to formulate a plan and/or connect you with others that may be able to assist. If I am experiencing such events, I will communicate them to you as well and we will adapt.
